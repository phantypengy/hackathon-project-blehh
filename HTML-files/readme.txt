Until we get the server, I'll commit all the .html, .js and .css files along with any assets and fonts used.

the file structure used here is how it's set up in the .html file, so if you're downloading this download it as is - 
e.g. to get an image for a thumbnail the .html file calls /assets/images/blake.png
